                <p>Hey everyone!<br/>

                I’ve been working with Java’s lambda expressions lately, and something has been bothering me: are we sacrificing readability for the sake of conciseness?

                I often see developers cramming everything into a single line, especially when using lambdas, streams, and method references. Sure, it looks clean and concise, but sometimes it’s just too hard to immediately figure out what the code is doing.</p>
